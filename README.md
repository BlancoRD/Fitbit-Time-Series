**Hypotheses**

 - There are patterns on Armstrong's daily activities.
 - Armstrong's fitness activity is affected by the month/season of the year.

**Deliverables**

- Report (in jupyter notebook)
- Prediction (.csv)
- Data dictionary (.xlsx)
- Presentation material (Link: )


**Data Science Skills Used**
 - Data prep and cleaning
 - Time Series Analysis
 - Visualization
 - Modeling using Parametric Methods
 - Modeling using the Prophet algorithm
 - Evaluation of Models


**Dependencies**

- Fitbit data (.csv)

- Multiple .py files to run model and reproduce the report

> acquire.py, 
summarize.py, 
prep.py, 
model.py

- Run through .ipynb

- Random states are set as 123 in the notebook
